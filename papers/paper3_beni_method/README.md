## Database Decision

This paper should use the **BENI v1 database** as its main empirical base:

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| Release | `BENI_unified_v1.0_preliminary` |
| Canonical data | `data-paper/data/processed/` |
| Main article file | `data/processed/beni_unified_articles_deduped.csv.zst` |
| Source components | Potrika (2014–2020) + BNAD (post-2020) |

The older `data/index/` outputs are prototype artifacts. The manuscript should be regenerated from BENI v1 before submission.

## Symlinks & Cross-References

| Path | Points To |
|------|-----------|
| `papers/paper3_beni_pipeline` | `papers/paper3_beni_method/manuscript/paper3_beni_pipeline/` |
| `data-paper/paper/paper3_beni_pipeline` | Same canonical manuscript target (via `../../`) |
| `data-paper/data/annotations` | (if symlink exists) |
| `data-paper/data/index` | (if symlink exists) |
| `data-paper/data/models` | (if symlink exists) |
| `data-paper/data/raw/macro` | (if symlink exists) |

## Derivative Map

| Content | Source |
|---------|--------|
| `data/processed/` (symlink) | `data-paper/data/processed/` |
| `data/annotations/` | Originally from `beni/annotation/` pipeline outputs |
| `data/index/` | Originally built by `beni/index/build_narrative_index.py` |
| `data/models/` | Trained from `beni/experiment/` |
| `manuscript/` | Independent LaTeX source (references `data/` for numbers) |

## Remaining Alignment Work

Before submission:

1. Standardize the authoritative LLM label set
2. Regenerate predictions, index files, and paper tables from BENI v1
3. Align manuscript numbers with the final data files
4. Fix LaTeX/PDF build warnings
